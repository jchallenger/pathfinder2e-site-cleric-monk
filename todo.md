- [ ] create an OverviewTab according to the tabs pattern to hold the character attributes. The "Skills" and their stats, descriptions and references should be visible here. The attributes should be based on the centralized config, and account for skill upgrades selected per level and other effects (bonuses or feats)
- [ ] review the skills andd feats tab; revise it so that it displays the upgrades selected by level instead of by type. 
- [ ] review SPELL_PREPARATION_REVIEW.md, and ensure it accounts for divine spells. then fix the implementation to be pathfinder 2e compliant
- [ ] polish the new tabs design. remove deprecated code and reduce lines of code by using share coimponents. ask me for preferences on design choices as they come up, and record it in the design guide.
- [ ] add an easy way to save or load from a pathbuilder json file, or reset my character to the DM provided build scaled for Level 8; test tabs with attributes that scale by level
- [ ] add hp +/-10 buttons
- [ ] the story teller tab is special; make it appear so. its button should be very slim in height, and full width.
