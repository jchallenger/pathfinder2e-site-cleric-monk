## Character Notes

### Character Concept
Generic Cleric is a Large-sized Minotaur Warpriest with Dragonblood heritage. This combination creates a powerful frontline divine caster capable of both devastating melee combat and potent healing magic. The dragonblood heritage provides resistance to fear effects, perfect for a warrior-priest who leads from the front.

### Tactical Role
- **Primary**: Frontline melee combatant with divine spellcasting
- **Secondary**: Healer and support (6 heal spells per day)
- **Tertiary**: Intimidation and battlefield control

### Key Strengths
1. **High HP**: 210 HP makes you extremely durable
2. **Legendary Saves**: All three saves are Legendary at level 20
3. **Divine Spellcasting**: Full progression with Legendary proficiency
4. **Healing Font**: 6 additional heal spells per day
5. **Large Size**: Increased reach and presence
6. **Darkvision**: No penalties in darkness
7. **Fear Immunity**: Dragonblood heritage effectively makes you immune to fear

### Combat Strategy
1. Use Shield Block to mitigate damage while engaging in melee
2. Deadly Simplicity makes unarmed strikes deal 1d8 damage
3. Natural horns provide an always-available 1d8 piercing attack
4. Cast buff spells before combat (Bless, Shield of Faith, etc.)
5. Use Healing Font for emergency healing without expending prepared spells
6. At higher levels, use Miraculous Spell for critical moments
